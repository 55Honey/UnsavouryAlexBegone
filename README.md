# UnsavouryAlexBegone

Unsavoury Alex Begone is a SQL module for 3.3.5a databases of Wrath of the Lich King compatible with AzerothCore.

It will remove any and all references to Alex Afrasiabi from the game.

Alex Afrasiabi's office was named the "crosby suite" by female employees who he sexually harassed and abused during his time at Blizzard. Alex Afrasiabi created many references to himself in WoW which aged poorly given this context. Items with the flavour texts "don't cry sunshine", "buckle up", "pools of tears", "bears the mark of Fras Siabi" etc. are present in the 3.3.5 files under his name.

The Warcraft team took inspiration from my module. 1 week after my module published, Blizzard did the same thing I did and removed all references to Alex Afrasiabi from the game.

The SQL is divided in 2 parts.

1) SQL that renames and adjusts GM-only items. No player will ever know you ran this query.

2) SQL that renames and adjusts all references, including obtainable items, quests, and NPCs in the world.
